## Dashboard for Server Management

The dashboard provides a centralized interface for managing servers, including server provisioning, configuration, monitoring, and maintenance. Key features include:

-   Provisioning new servers.
-   Real-time monitoring of server health and resource utilization.
-   Identifying and addressing potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

## Reporting and Analytics

This component offers advanced reporting and analytics capabilities:

-   Data aggregation from various sources.
-   Visualization using Grafana with dynamic charts and tables.
-   Custom report generation based on specific metrics and time periods.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC ensures secure access to sensitive information:

-   User roles (e.g., administrator, manager, technician) with assigned permissions.
-   Access to configured resources (CRs) restricted to designated users or service accounts.

## Kube-State-Metrics (KSM) for H/VPA Recommendations

KSM and Grafana are used for tracking and visualizing pod scaling metrics, enabling informed scaling decisions.

## Dynamic Open Policy Agent (OPA) Policy Configuration

Users can enable/disable OPA policies dynamically via the frontend, offering flexibility in policy management while maintaining security standards.

## Load Balancer (LB) Management & Metrics

LBs are deployed for efficient traffic distribution, with real-time metrics provided by KSM.

## Certificate Management

Utilizes cert-manager to automate TLS certificate issuance and renewal for secure communication.

## RBACs for Configured Resources

Defines access boundaries for sensitive data sources based on user roles.

## Dashboard for Raw Kubectl Exploration

Users can execute kubectl commands in raw/proxy mode directly from the dashboard, facilitating Kubernetes resource management.

## Hardware Monitoring & Alerts

Integrates Prometheus Exporters to monitor hardware-related metrics and configure alerts for hardware anomalies or failures.

## Alert Management

Extends Prometheus AlertManager to manage alerts from various metrics and integrates with communication platforms like Slack.

## Database Integration

Optionally, consider adding a component for caching frequently accessed data and introducing AI/ML-driven "Data Insights" for trend prediction.

## Kubernetes Auditing & Security Dashboard

Implements a UI-based tool for intuitive Kubernetes audit log overview and explores third-party security solutions for automated threat detection, vulnerability scanning, and policy violation alerts.
